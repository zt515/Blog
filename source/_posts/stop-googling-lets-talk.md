#### Enjoying food laying upon the table, and playing with the mobile phone in your hand. It seems like that this kind of life is of great pleasure. But have you noticed that the handsome guy across the table has been in a state of being ignored?

#### Mobile phones and the Internet have been invented to make our lives more convenient, and their purpose is to make people's communication free from time and space constraints. But now the phone has long been farther and farther down the road that was originally planned for. Despite this, the situation is still far from the worst. In the past few decades, the contradiction between people is nothing more than an imbalance between gain and loss. But now, anyway, we have another challenge thrown in our path: phubbing. This word blends “phone” with “snubbing” and it is wreaking havoc on intimacy. It is destroying our social communication.

#### As is universally acknowledged that there’s always a special quality about face-to-face interactions regardless of whether you are dating someone, talking someone, or just meeting someone for the first time. You can not only catch the subtle tone in their voice, see their expression as it changes from sad to outraged, but also look into their eyes to see whether you can trust them.

#### So it's really a disaster for us to let the mobile phones take over the face-to-face communication in our life. An American researcher Sherry Turkle observed a 15-year-old girl on her reaction when she went out to dinner with her father and he took out his phone to add "facts" to their conversation. "Daddy, " she said, "stop Googling. I want to chat with you." In my point of view, this is not just a girl's request to her father. I think this is more of a family member's call for affection. Once a college junior tried to capture what is wrong about life in his generation. "Our texts are fine," he said. "It’s what texting does to our conversations when we are together that’s the problem."

#### Through the mobile phones, what we see is not the sincere eyes of the other person, but a desire to escape from the real life and invest in the virtual world. It's we that created everything for the virtual world, but now the virtual world is trying to control us. It is high time that we took actions to say no to phubbings! 

#### On the one hand, to make our life return to normal, the first and the most important thing we are supposed to do is to spend more time with our families to make up for the lost time taken by mobile phones. They must be very happy if they see you disconnected with virtual world and "reconnected" to the real world. But on the other hand, the normal use of mobile phones is completely acceptable, so we have to make the most of the functions correctly and restrain ourselves from being addicted to them. 

#### In the end, I sincerely appeal to everyone to take our own temperature back to the vast world and put down the phone to bring love back to life's trajectory. After all, the real world is the real home to human beings, and the virtual world can not take its place in any case!
