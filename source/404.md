## Here's to the crazy ones:
</br>
## The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, 
## the round pegs in the square holes,
## the ones who see things differently.
</br>
## They're not fond of rules, 
## and they have no respect for the status quo.
</br>
## You can quote them, disagree with them, 
## glorify or vilify them, but the only thing 
## you can't do is ignore them
## because they change things. 
</br>
## They invent.
## They imagine.
## They heal.
## They explore.
## They create.
## They inspire.
## They push the human race forward.
</br>
## Maybe they have to be crazy.
## How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?
## Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?
## Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
</br>
## We make tools for these kinds of people.
</br>
## While some may see them as the crazy ones,
## we see genius.
</br>
## Because
</br>
## Only those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,
## are the ones who do.
</br>
